# NumPy Basics: Fundamental Concepts

**👋 This repository documents my personal journey and progress in learning the core functionalities of the NumPy (Numerical Python) library.**

It serves as a focused collection of examples and code snippets covering essential NumPy concepts, built specifically to reinforce my understanding of efficient numerical computation in Python.


## 📚 Core Topics Covered

This repository contains dedicated files (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts) structured to cover the **essential NumPy functionalities** you want to learn:

| Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **01-Array_Creation** | Detailed methods for creating arrays: `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`, and `np.linspace()`. |
| **02-Attributes** | Understanding and retrieving array properties like `shape`, `ndim` (number of dimensions), `size`, and `dtype`. |
| **03-Indexing_Slicing** | Accessing specific elements or subsets of arrays using standard indexing, slicing (`[start:stop:step]`), and advanced boolean/integer indexing. |
| **04-Arithmetic_Operations** | Performing fast, element-wise arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.). |
| **05-Broadcasting** |  Explaining how NumPy handles operations on arrays with different shapes and ensuring you understand the rules. |
| **06-Aggregate_Functions** | Using functions to summarize data: `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.max()`, `np.min()`, and performing aggregation along specific axes (`axis=0`, `axis=1`). |
| **07-Random_Numbers** | Generating random data using `np.random` module functions like `np.random.rand()`, `np.random.randint()`, and `np.random.randn()`. |

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nupoork8/numpy_basics.git](https://github.com/nupoork8/numpy_basics.git)
    cd numpy_basics
    ```

2.  **Install NumPy:**
    If you don't have NumPy already, install it using `pip` (or `conda`):
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    # or
    conda install numpy
    ```
